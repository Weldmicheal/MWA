1.In node app we have callbacks. These callbacks are inserted in their corresponding eventloop queues. When ever
the result is ready, it triggers the call back in the eventloop queue and sent to V8 for 
execution. Hence, we say Node is event-driven because an event( in this case the result) triggers the callback 
in the eventloop queue to be sent to V8.

2. Yes, we can write. We have two types of codes, synchronous and asynchronous. For the asynchronous, we need
event to trigger the call back. For the synchronous code, however, the execution is done v8 itself without requiring
an event/result to trigger the execution.

3.Layout tree only displays pages that are in the visible window. That is to say, it doesn't render beyond the
visible page. Chrome incorporates this behaviour for better and efficient rendering performace of web pages.
